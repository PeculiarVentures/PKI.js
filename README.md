PKIjs provides a Typescript implementation of the most common formats and algorithms needed to build PKI-enabled applications

## Capabilities

- The creation and validation of X.509 certificates (RFC 5280) is used by all certificate-enabled applications.
- PKCS#10 (RFC 2986) is the most commonly used enrollment data structure used by X.509 applications. It enables the requestor to prove control of a given public key.
- Cryptographic Message Syntax (RFC 5652) is the most commonly used data structure for signing data in X.509 applications. CMS makes it easy to both sign and represent all of the data needed to verify a signature.
- Cryptographic Message Syntax (RFC 5652) is also the most commonly used data structure for encrypting data in X.509 applications. CMS makes it easy to provide interoperable data encryption.
- Time-Stamp Protocol (RFC 3161) is the most commonly used protocol for proving that data
existed before a particular time. It is commonly used in signing applications to ensure signatures are verifiable long into the future.

## Objectives
- Typescript and object-oriented implementation
- Contains no cryptographic implementations and instead leverages Web Crypto API
- Work uniformly both in browser and in [Node](https://nodejs.org/)/[Deno](https://deno.com/)

## Installation

To install the stable version:

```bash
npm install --save pkijs
```

This assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.
